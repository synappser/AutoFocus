# AutoFocus

**A focus-follows-mouse implementation on steroids!**

**AutoFocus**, formerly named AutoRaise, takes its inspiration from the discontinued **Zooom/2** [Auto Raise](https://img.informer.com/screenshots_mac/19/19146_1.png) feature and extends it with a very powerful and flexible workflow in a modern modular Swift codebase.
