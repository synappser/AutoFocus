# AutoFocus

**A focus-follows-mouse implementation on steroids!**

**AutoFocus**, formerly named AutoRaise, takes its inspiration from the discontinued **Zooom/2** [Auto Raise](https://img.informer.com/screenshots_mac/19/19146_1.png) feature and extends it with a very powerful and flexible workflow in a modern modular Swift codebase.

This repository is a placeholder for its public beta issues and feature requests.

## FAQ

#### Is this a pre-release?

Yes, AutoFocus is currently in public beta.

#### Is it free to download?

Yes, AutoFocus is free while it's in beta.

#### What's the purpose of the "Handle Desktop as a window" option?

While this is disabled by default, AutoFocus can handle the Desktop just as another window, meaning that when the cursor is over the Desktop, the most recent Finder window will be brought to the front. This doesn't seem like much but imagine digging through several applications windows to raise that Finder window back.

But wait, there's much more to it. It auto highlights and gives back focus to the item that was previously selected on the Desktop. It is very handy not to lose where you left oï¬€ if you had selected something on the Desktop and it was buried under other windows. There is also a helpful shortcut for quickly minimizing all Finder windows that may stand in your way to the Desktop. You can just hold down Shift and move the cursor to minimize them all and vice versa.

It's hard to explain just with words, watch the [introductory video](https://synappser.github.io/apps/autofocus/) at slow motion starting at 1:12 and I am sure you'll adopt it. Early private beta testers ended up using it daily. It's a real lifesaver when productivity is your primary concern to be able to snap-back to your Desktop selection!
